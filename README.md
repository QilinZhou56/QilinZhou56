## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, I'm Qilin, a second-year graduate student at UChicago. My journey spans the dynamic fields of Data Science, Social Research, and Business Management, with Python as my cornerstone language. My current focus is on mastering machine learning and advanced computer vision techniques, primarily through TensorFlow. I'm also venturing into deploying deep learning models within Spark and MapReduce environments to tackle complex data challenges. Additionally, I'm expanding my toolkit by learning Flask for web development, aiming to bridge the gap between analytical insights and practical applications. This multidisciplinary approach reflects my commitment to leveraging technology for impactful solutions.
